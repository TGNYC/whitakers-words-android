A compiled version of words 1.97FC is included in assets/words. This is because android ndk does not support ada, nor do most cross compiler toolchains.

Compilation procedure:
- Download and extract the source code (http://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/wordsall.zip)
- Set up an environment that allows compilation of ada code for arm processors. I used a raspian chroot in qemu, with the "gnat" package installed. You can also cross-compile, if you can figure out how to set that up.
- Run the following command:
    > gnatmake -O3 words -bargs -static
    > gnatmake makedict
    > gnatmake makestem
    > gnatmake makeefil
    > gnatmake makeinfl
    > echo G | ./makedict
    > echo G | ./makestem
    > echo G | ./makeefil
    > echo G | ./makeinfl
- You can then copy all the required files into assets/words.
